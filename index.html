                <h3>Apostles Creed</h3>
                <p>I believe in God, the Father Almighty, Creator of Heaven and earth;
                    <br />and in Jesus Christ, His only Son Our Lord,
                    <br />Who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary,
                    <br />suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried.
                    <br />He descended into Hell; the third day He rose again from the dead;
                    <br />He ascended into Heaven, and sitteth at the right hand of God, the Father almighty;
                    <br />from thence He shall come to judge the living and the dead.
                    <br />I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy Catholic Church, the communion of saints,
                    <br />the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body and life everlasting.</p>

                <h3>(Optional) Nicene Creed</h3>
                <p>I believe in one God, the Father, the Almighty,
                    <br />Maker of heaven and earth, of all things visible and invisible.
                    <br />I believe in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God,
                    <br />born of the Father before all ages,
                    <br />God from God, Light from Light, true God from true God,
                    <br />begotten, not made, consubstantial with the Father.
                    <br />Through him all things were made.
                    <br />For us and for our salvation he came down from heaven:
                    <br />by the power of the Holy Spirit was incarnate of the Virgin Mary,
                    <br />and became man.
                    <br />For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;
                    <br />he suffered death and was buried, and rose again on the third day
                    <br />in accordance with the Scriptures.
                    <br />He ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father.
                    <br />He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,
                    <br />and his kingdom will have no end.
                    <br />I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,
                    <br />who proceeds from the Father and the Son.
                    <br />With the Father and the Son he is adored and glorified.
                    <br />He has spoken through the Prophets.
                    <br />I believe in one, holy, catholic and apostolic Church.
                    <br />I confess one baptism for the forgiveness of sins,
                    <br />and I look forward to the resurrection of the dead,
                    <br />and the life of the world to come.</p>

                    <br />Blessed art thou among women,
                    <br />and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

                    <br />To thee do we cry, poor banished children of Eve. 
                    <br />To thee do we send up our sighs mourning and weeping in this valley of tears.
                    <br />Turn then, most gracious advocate, thine eyes of mercy toward us,
                    <br />and after this our exile show us the blessed fruit of thy womb, Jesus.
                    <br />O clement, O loving, O sweet Virgin Mary.
                    <br />Pray for us, O Holy Mother of God.
                    <br />That we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ.</p>
